2048 game

This is what I tried to write using the two-dimensional graphics arrangement and basic C++ grammar I learned.

This is a programming that I think is more interestin
Further understand and imitate a game that conforms to the rules.
I spent more than an hour making the prototype.
And later used #include <fstream> to add the function of "recording the highest score of a single person".
