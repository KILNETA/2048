# 2048
2048 game

This is what I tried to write using the two-dimensional graphics arrangement and basic C++ grammar I learned.

This is a programming that I think is more interesting
Further understand and imitate a game that conforms to the rules
I spent more than an hour making the prototype
And later used #include <fstream> to add the function of "recording the highest score of a single person"
